<h4>Faced with a list of the Restaurant Inspection Results in New York City for the last year, at first I wanted to know:
<h1>What is the dirtiest street to eat on in New York?</h1>
<p>I had written a story last year about <a href="http://observer.com/2014/04/signs-of-life-pest-problems-plague-sohos-chicest-food-spots/">bugs falling from a ceiling</a> at Blue Ribbon Sushi in SoHo, shortly after news of <a href="http://observer.com/2014/04/dominique-ansel-bakery-closed-for-hundreds-of-mice-droppings/">mice droppings</a> at nearby Dominique Ansel Bakery. It got me thinking about how a lot of the buildings in this area, never mind that it's an in-demand spot for a restaurant, are so old and so prone to these kinds of health violations.</p>

<p>I set out to make a pivot table with the streets as the row headings and the number of violation points as the value. But then I quickly realized that some of the streets were typed differently and were turning up multiple times, or in some rare cases, were two different streets in different boroughs, but with the same name. So I went back and added boroughs as the column heading, then cleaned up the data, adding up values that were for the same street and also differentiating between unique streets. E.g. Broadway Manhattan, Broadway Brooklyn, Broadway Queens.</p>
<p>Then I went back to the pivot table and computed for the percentage of the violation points for each street compared to the grand total, then sorted them from highest to lowest.</p>

<p>What I got instead were disappointing values for the percentages. They were so low, like below 1% for each, which was understandable since there are so many streets in New York.</p>
<p>So then I went back to my problem statement and asked myself what I really wanted to know. Which led me to:</p>
<h1>What is the dirtiest street to eat on in Manhattan?</h2>
<p>I then filtered my data to show only Manhattan, then did the averages and sorting from there. Lo and behold, it turned up <font color="red">Broadway, 2nd Avenue</font> and <font color="red">Madison Avenue</font> as the top three "dirtiest streets." (The percentages were at 3, 2 and 1% respectively; already pretty big for me to see considering my earlier resuslts of 0.0-something percent. Plus the fact that there were 300 streets surveyed in Manhattan.)</p>
<p>The fact that Broadway and Second Avenue showed up actually supported my theory about neighborhoods with older or even pre-war buildings as being prone to sanitation problems. I want to investigate if the same is true for Madison Avenue, whether or not the buildings surveyed were some of these older ones or the newer developments that line it.</p>
