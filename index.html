<a href="data.xls">Restaurant Inspection Data</a>

<h4>Faced with a list of the Restaurant Inspection Results in New York City for the last year, at first I wanted to know what is the dirtiest street to eat on in New York? I had written a story last year about <a href="http://observer.com/2014/04/signs-of-life-pest-problems-plague-sohos-chicest-food-spots/">falling bugs</a> from a ceiling at Blue Ribbon Sushi in SoHo, shortly after news of a mice infestation at nearby Dominique Ansel Bakery. It got me thinking about how a lot of the buildings in this area—pretty much a hot spot to have a restaurant in—are so old and so prone to these kinds of violations. And if maybe sometimes the solution to the problem of cleanliness is way beyond the restaurant owner's control. Maybe they should just move out.</h4>

<p>Anyway, I set out to make a pivot table with the streets as the row headings and the number of violation points as the value. But then I quickly realized that some of the streets were typed differently and were turning up multiple times, or in some rare cases, were two different streets in different boroughs, but with the same name. So, I actually went back and added boroughs as the column heading for that pviot table I had just created.</p>
<p>I then cleaned up the data, adding up those values that were for the same street, and also differentiating between unique streets. For example, Broadway Manhattan, Broadway Brooklyn, Broadway Queens.</p>
<p>Then I went back to the pivot table and computed for the percentage of the violation points for each street over the grand total. Then, I sorted them from highest to lowest. What I got instead were disappointing values for the percentages. They were so low, like below 1% for each, which was understandable since there are so many streets in New York.</p>
<p>So then I went back to my problem statement and asked myself what I really wanted to know. Which led me to: What is the dirtiest street in Manhattan?</p>
<p>I then went back to my data, filtered them to show only Manhattan, then did the averages and sorting from there. Lo and behold, it turned up Broadway, 2nd Avenue and Madison Avenue as the top three "dirtiest streets." (The percentages were at 3, 2 and 1 % respectively—already pretty big for me to see considering my earlier resuslts of 0.0-something percent, and the fact that there were 300 streets surveyed for Manhattan.)</p>
<p>The fact that Broadway and Second Avenue showed up actually supported my theory about neighborhoods with older or even pre-war buildings as not being an ideal spot to set up shop, sanitation-wise. I want to investigate if the same is true for Madison Avenue, whether or not the buildings surveyed were some of these older ones or the newer developments that line it.</p>
