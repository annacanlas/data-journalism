And the social conversation favors things that generations of politicians have been trained to avoid: spontaneity, surprise, authenticity, humor, raw edge, the occasional human stumble. (Joe Biden!)

The World Health Organization, keeper of the official Ebola numbers, was giving no hint that the shape of the epidemic had radically changed, so Jina worked her vast array of official and unofficial sources to verify the new pattern.', 'She started with the data, spending two and a half hours with the Health Ministry\xe2\x80\x99s numbers cruncher who supplies the WHO with data.

It requires specialized training to avoid Ebola and a plan to give Jina the best medical care should, god forbid, she contract the virus.

It\xe2\x80\x99s core to how we operate and how we hire.', 'As we enter another round of intense growth and hiring, I thought it was important to make clear our vision and to put out numbers that will help keep us accountable \xe2\x80\x94 to you, to our readers, and to others in our industry who care. Almost everyone here plays some role in hiring, and so I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked some editors to help come up with this statement of what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build and why. We\xe2\x80\x99ve also decided to share the current demographic data for the editorial operation and the company, as of September 2014, at the bottom of this e-mail.', 'So here it is, our rough and evolving hiring guide:', 'A definition:', 'BuzzFeed\xe2\x80\x99s working definition of diversity is this: enough people of a particular group that no one person has to represent the supposed viewpoint of their group \xe2\x80\x94 whether ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, gender identity, socioeconomic background, or disability. And if the group is a small one we should never expect one person to be the \xe2\x80\x9cdiverse\xe2\x80\x9d reporter or writer, or to speak for anyone other than themselves.', '4 Reasons It Matters:', 'First is the ethical imperative: Our industry, like all industries, should be open to anyone prepared to join it, and our industry, like most industries, has historically been terrible at inclusivity. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake to look at diversity solely as an ethical imperative. In fact, diversity is an urgent and unending project for anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious about journalism and entertainment on the internet. Here are three reasons why:', '\xe2\x80\xa2 Reaching more readers: The internet is, in some ways, organized around identity. News and entertainment companies have often alienated or failed to reach consumers who don\xe2\x80\x99t hold the characteristics of the straight, white everyman. We are a new kind of media company with the opportunity to reach a huge global audience, and we need to build an organization that\xe2\x80\x99s capable of connecting with a vast range of readers.', '\xe2\x80\xa2 Hiring the best people: We have hired many of the best writers, editors, and reporters in the world, from a wildly diverse group of backgrounds. We want to keep doing that. Very few people, including minorities, would choose to be a tiny minority at work \xe2\x80\x94 or to work only with people just like them. In fact, most of the greatest journalists and writers will, all things being equal, choose to work in a diverse newsroom. We want them all to come work for us.', '\xe2\x80\xa2 Doing better work: Diversity makes us a better editorial operation. Underrepresented writers and journalists don\xe2\x80\x99t exist to solely to speak to readers who look like them. Diversity helps editorial organizations avoid the bland and often false conventional wisdom held in a room full of people who come from similar places. Having diverse writers on staff also brings a much wider array of stories that matter, and to more people. To get the biggest stories in the country and the world, we need as many insiders in as many communities as possible.', 'With all of this in mind, and in order to maximize our ability to create a great, diverse newsroom, we\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with a list of five things editors should do when hiring:', '1) Understand the beat or field you\xe2\x80\x99re hiring in:', 'There are some fields in the media that boast large, diverse pools of smart, hard-working people. There are other fields \xe2\x80\x94 particularly the most elite, like investigative reporting \xe2\x80\x94 that currently have smaller, whiter candidate pools. We often use our personal networks to hire from both, but in the first case, those networks can limit us. The latter is a harder problem, and one where we should be seeking to improve the pipeline ourselves.', '2) Insist on a diverse pool of serious candidates:', 'The final interview round should never just be several straight white men. One key is casting a wide net: Jobs should be listed whenever possible \xe2\x80\x94 having a link to send to a wide variety of networks makes it more likely that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a diverse pool of candidates. And be thoughtful about the wording of job listings, and of using language in ways that inadvertently signals that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a guy, for someone who\xe2\x80\x99s straight, or for someone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a disability.', '3) Look for opportunities to make hires that will increase the diversity of our readership:', 'We\xe2\x80\x99ve been focusing this year on news and buzz aimed at stories about and of interest to Latinos, which is to say, to a large share of Americans. The writers doing that aren\xe2\x80\x99t all Latino, but naturally most are. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep hiring obsessively focused maniacs, as we always have, at times to focus on the obsessions of one group or another \xe2\x80\x94 with the understanding that the organization of the web around identity often means that these are the most widely shared topics.', '4) Tap networks beyond your own:', 'Make an effort to look outside of job board applications and personal networks: To start, that means emailing the job to colleagues and journalists and writers elsewhere who are more connected to underrepresented communities. But it also means getting creative and seeking out great diverse journalists on your own \xe2\x80\x94 try HBCUs, professional organizations, and publications made for non-white audiences. Joel Greengrass\xe2\x80\x99 talent team is very focused on finding the right events and making the right connections; we recently had recruiters and senior editors at the National Association of Black Journalists convention, and will be at OUTC in October and the National Hispanic Media Convention in November.', '5) Create our own pipelines:', 'Tommy Wesely has done an outstanding job of creating, in our fellowship program, a diverse pipeline of current and future BuzzFeed stars. We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to invest in that program, of course, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll also be looking looking to expand that vision in a couple of ways:', '\xe2\x80\xa2 Chances to create opportunities for mid-career journalists to become the top reporters of tomorrow.

Virtually all other contests were \xe2\x80\x9ccalled\xe2\x80\x9d by only one entity: the AP. The news wire neither rushes nor explains its decisions, which have been turned into a different kind of mysterious black box in part because it is bound contractually to share its results first with the news organizations who pay for those decisions. The AP essentially controlled when Americans learned who won an election.', 'But something significant has changed in the last few years: The geeky new obsession with political data. It really started with liberal bloggers who took polling seriously, and with the nerd king Nate Silver, who made his name reassuring Democrats that Barack Obama was, still, winning.', 'The conversation has moved from polling to the polls. The people counting the actual votes \xe2\x80\x94 county officials across the United States \xe2\x80\x94 have started putting precinct-by-precinct tallies online. Now that same data that only the AP could access, anyone can access. And so a group of a couple dozen devoted journalists and partisans assemble on Twitter on Tuesday nights through the summer and fall to watch election returns, county by county, pop up on the websites of registrars and clerks. They parse the results as they come in, they argue over what they mean, and sometimes they catch the sort of substantial errors \xe2\x80\x94 transposed digits, or uncounted ballots \xe2\x80\x94 that happen occasionally in preliminary election counts. They typically reach a consensus about who will win long before the AP has made its once-definitive call, based on the same factors the AP looks at \xe2\x80\x94 the likelihood that the candidate who trails in the vote can close the gap with the outstanding votes, given both statistics and the voting history of the precincts waiting to be counted.', 'Now Finnigan and his ragtag Decision Desk have taken that transformation a step further. His volunteers, unlike the rest of amateur and professional media alike, don\xe2\x80\x99t just rely on published figures and AP tallies.

It\xe2\x80\x99s the next logical step for the small fraternity of election-night analysts, doing in public what the large media institutions have typically done in the dark. And while they have a tiny fraction of the AP\xe2\x80\x99s roughly 5,000 local reporters gathering results, they naturally focus on the relative handful of races of national interest, and have become central to a political conversation that has been for years now shaped on Twitter.

One major difference is the scale: The AP calls state legislative contests in 50 states, county, and city races in some places, for an expected total of more than 5,000 this year.', 'Another is the philosophy. The AP believes, for instance, that it has a public trust not to issue its magical call on major races in situations where that could prevent people from turning out for still-competitive down-ballot ones. So this August in Hawaii, where voting was delayed in two storm-damaged precincts for a week, the AP waited a week before calling the Democratic senatorial primary \xe2\x80\x94 despite the fact that results from the other precincts made the result a foregone conclusion.', '\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything that suppresses voter turnout,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buzbee.', 'For Finnigan, who had made the call on election night, calling was a matter of simple math, and of transparency with what was, after all, public data: \xe2\x80\x9cThere was absolutely no way those districts were going to overturn [Brian] Schatz\xe2\x80\x99s lead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.', 'In the radical transparency of Twitter and the web, there\xe2\x80\x99s also less of a trade-off between speed and accuracy than the AP has.

In the waning days of the 2012 election, many conservatives simply refused to believe public polling suggesting President Obama would easily win reelection. Instead, they resorted to amateur \xe2\x80\x9cunskewing\xe2\x80\x9d of the polls \xe2\x80\x94 removing Democrats from their samples.

Tech\xe2\x80\x99s generally progressive stands on social issues are a good fit with Democrats.

A new wave of those are being born too, led by Brigade and by Crowdpac.com, among others.

Again, I grew up learning about and living among white, Asian, indigenous, and Afro-Latinos, so the idea that one can indeed hold multiple identities is not foreign to me. Besides, there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between race and ethnicity. Today, I identify as white (but not capital-W \xe2\x80\x9cWhite\xe2\x80\x9d), Cuban, and Latina.

I think of Latinidad less as a fixed category that you either fall into or not and more as a network of solidarity based on a shared history. To call yourself Latino or Latina is, in my mind, to cast your lot with other people whose position in the world was shaped by the history of Spanish and Portuguese colonialism in the Americas. When you call yourself Latino or Latina, you are assuming your part in that history \xe2\x80\x94 whether you ancestors did good or bad things \xe2\x80\x94 and you decide that you want to take responsibility for redeeming what went wrong and continues to go wrong with that history.

And I dig that.', 'It\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to use this one word/identity to define a huge group of people, but Nico, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there\xe2\x80\x99s always a \xe2\x80\x9cshared\xe2\x80\x9d history as much an implied one. As Latin American Studies grad students, we spent an entire year studying Spanish influences on Latin America, and one day discussing anything about Brazil. I feel warmly when I\xe2\x80\x99m accepted as a Latina, but there\xe2\x80\x99s always a moment of pause and separation when I remind people that Brazil is still a part of the whole jam.

Latinidad is something that exists, directly or indirectly, in relation to the United States: as interventionist power, as immigrant destination, as finishing school and playground for elites. This may be one reason why it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for Latin Americans from different countries to relate to one another in the United States than in Latin America itself. Which reminds me \xe2\x80\x94 for me personally, being Latino in the United States is less something I feel internally than something I feel when I communicate with others. I\xe2\x80\x99m Latino when I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking Spanish in Queens, not necessarily when I\xe2\x80\x99m walking around Central Park. Obviously, this has to do with the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m also American, I\xe2\x80\x99m white, and I speak accentless English. As such, my being Latino is never wielded against me or thrown in my face, and often isn\xe2\x80\x99t even perceived \xe2\x80\x94 which is not the case with most Latinos and with many in this discussion.', '', 'That we are all the same.

It hurts and it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to come up against the fact that this part of you that you love isn\xe2\x80\x99t always perfect. There\xe2\x80\x99s definitely something to the idea that as representatives of the Latino community we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt our own cause by coming to terms with the serious failings that do exist. But being visible and complete as a diverse entity requires having some discussions that aren\xe2\x80\x99t always easy.', 'I have always felt that colorism and race is the biggest elephant in the room in the Latino community. Both are extremely prevalent, yet nobody ever talks about it. I am dark compared with most of my relatives and friends, and have always been treated differently because of it. Class is also a factor that ties into that. The people who have the most also coincidentally have the most European blood and a lighter complexion. It is even present in Spanish- and Portuguese-language media. If it ain\xe2\x80\x99t white, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t right.', 'Some of this is so ingrained in Latino families.

I would add that there are Latinos of all classes. Sure, we are all Latinos \xe2\x80\x94 but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we get a free pass to not contend with the very real differences among us. The fact that there are light-skinned Mexicans at the helm of tech companies, for example, should not be counted as a political victory for Latinos.', 'That\xe2\x80\x99s another flaw in how Latinos are represented in both American culture overall and within Spanish-language media \xe2\x80\x94 by showing mostly light-skinned or, like, \xe2\x80\x9clightly bronzed\xe2\x80\x9d Caucasian Latinos, it not only fails to represent all the different races within this group, it also works to portray us as a monolith that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have its own issues to work through. Classism and colorism cast very, very long shadows over U.S. Latinos and Latin Americans, and have from the get-go. To ignore that is to ignore both the current reality of what it means to be part of the Latino experience, broad as that is, as well as the history of Latinos. So when I read something like the', 'or', 'article on Latinos \xe2\x80\x9cbecoming\xe2\x80\x9d white or choosing to identify as a certain race, it essentially ignores or glosses over the colorism and classism present within the community.', 'Adding to Alex\xe2\x80\x99s point, we like to blame English-language media a lot \xe2\x80\x94 but we also have to look at ourselves for how our Spanish-language media puts white people up on a pedestal.

How would she care for their two teenage children, Zach (Graham Phillips) and Grace (Makenzie Vega), while juggling a demanding career and competing with associates 20 years younger than her?

Or it might not: The show has proven itself impossible to predict at times, not least of all because of the suspended Alicia/Kalinda developments. It\xe2\x80\x99s Alicia who brings up the affair, and Alicia who seems to be carrying a grudge \xe2\x80\x94 and yet Margulies makes her enmity all the more sympathetic because of how nuanced her performance is.

After standing by her man at press conferences in which the most personal details of her private life were held out for the 24-hour news cycle, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it just be perfect if she ended up replacing Peter, at least symbolically, in the position he held when their lives imploded?', 'But Alicia has a lot to consider: the current S.A., James Castro (Michael Cerveris), has a vendetta against her; her partner Cary is currently facing trial for drug-related charges; Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) has now joined them at the firm as a new partner; her nascent campaign is already compromised thanks to Bishop; and there is more trouble at home. Which brings us back to the opposition research of this week\xe2\x80\x99s episode, written by the Kings; even as Alicia must confront what Eli (Alan Cumming) and her potential campaign manager Jonathan Elfman (Steven Pasquale) are telling her about her own life and that of her family. Alicia\xe2\x80\x99s coldness, her ability to compartmentalize, her fury at Zach \xe2\x80\x94 after discovering that he lied to her about his girlfriend having an abortion \xe2\x80\x94 is further compounded by the fact that Alicia realizes that she should have noticed what was going on in her home. Her flashbacks to Zach and Nisa (Rachel Hilson) kissing in his bedroom, and of Zach furtively washing his sheets, reveal the conflict at play inside Alicia\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Is she guilty of not paying enough attention to her kids? Has she placed her role as a partner above that of mother?', 'These are not the things that race through Peter\xe2\x80\x99s mind, by the way: The show is clear to depict the weight of this discovery on Alicia, and she masks her guilt by lashing out, by making a list, by sublimating her emotion over the telephone and channeling it inward. It is a reminder that working mothers don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of looking the other way, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder that the sacrifices that Alicia has made do carry heavy consequences.', 'CBS', 'CBS', 'That\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to', 'itself, which never shies away from portraying its characters as realistically flawed (even \xe2\x80\x9cSaint Alicia\xe2\x80\x9d herself) or as second-guessing themselves, even as the show itself takes bigger and bigger risks with its storytelling.

In the pilot episode, Viola Davis\xe2\x80\x99 Annalise Keating is shown receiving oral sex from a man who is most definitely not her husband.

As the season progresses and conditions at Litchfield become worse and worse \xe2\x80\x94 because of venal officials, embezzlement schemes, force majeure, and general lack of empathy or interest \xe2\x80\x94 it becomes clear that these inmates have permanently slipped through the cracks as the most basic requirements of the prison system (keeping these women \xe2\x80\x9csafe and clean\xe2\x80\x9d) are not even being met. (The bubbling up of sewage from the toilets becomes an emblem of the corruption and rot at work here.)', 'The freedom of choice within the non-Litchfield lives of the corrections officers \xe2\x80\x94 even Fig (Alysia Reiner), the mercenary assistant warden, gets some deeper shading this season as her life implodes \xe2\x80\x94 appears to be wholly at odds with that of the women the officers are sworn to protect.

Joe Caputo (Nick Sandow), the masturbatory administrator, becomes a hero of sorts over the course of the season until he too is seduced by power, opting not to do the right thing or even listen to it, such as when Matt McGorry\xe2\x80\x99s Bennett confesses that he got inmate Daya (Dascha Polanco) pregnant. The truth becomes an inconvenience, something to be shrugged off and compartmentalized. It\xe2\x80\x99s far easier, then, just to put a Band-Aid on matters, to drag out a nun (Beth Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s Sister Jane Ingalls) to make a pre-scripted statement. Caputo sees himself as a savior of these women, but he chooses ultimately to perpetuate the broken system that surrounds them. The prison officials are, in actuality, also just as trapped \xe2\x80\x94 by red tape, by bureaucracy, by personal desire, by anger issues \xe2\x80\x94 as the inmates.', '', 'And in Season 2, viewers see just how dire things have become at Litchfield. Gone are the days of yoga and free doughnuts. Heroin floods the prison, thanks to the arrival of sociopath Vee (the great Lorraine Toussaint in a tour de force performance); bathrooms fester from raw sewage; a shot quota is initiated; the backup generators are missing fuel; rats circle out-of-date donations during a tropical storm; a hunger strike begins as an attempt to protest the savage use of SHU as a punishment; and Jimmy (Pat Squire), a senile and elderly inmate, is given \xe2\x80\x9ccompassionate release,\xe2\x80\x9d dumped at a bus station when she becomes a problem that officials don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like solving.', 'Whereas before there was some semblance of unity, fractures develop not only in Litchfield\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure, but in its interpersonal relationships: Factions form, dissolve, and reform. Best friends Taystee (Danielle Brooks) and Poussey (Samira Wiley) are at one another\xe2\x80\x99s throats. Suzanne (Uzo Aduba) becomes violent under the tutelage of Vee, her brutal confrontation with Poussey revealing just how damaged Taystee and her friends have become since Vee arrived. The relationship between Piper (Taylor Schilling) and the devious Alex (Laura Prepon, who appears in four episodes this season) splinters yet again, as does Piper\xe2\x80\x99s on-again-off-again romance with Larry (Jason Biggs). The \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d gathered around ex-prison cook Red (Kate Mulgrew) falls apart entirely without her as their anchor, with Nicky (Natasha Lyonne) and the others turning their back on their former protector. Even Pennsatucky (Taryn Manning) falls out with her fellow laundry room meth heads after she gets new, shiny white teeth.', 'Throughout it all, there\xe2\x80\x99s the notion here that prison is a crucible that tests one\xe2\x80\x99s character, revealing ultimately who each of the inmates truly is. Piper embodies this notion, telling an old couple, while on furlough to attend her grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, that prison hasn\xe2\x80\x99t diminished who she was, but has revealed who she truly is. That carries through the season as a whole; Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) is exposed as a lunatic stalker, but inside the prison, she is somehow thoughtful and kind, gracious and loyal. Prison strips away the artifice to display one\xe2\x80\x99s true character at the core. Piper is tougher than she knew; her fight with Pennsatucky at the end of Season 1 reinforced this. Her gentility and na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 have been somewhat (for Piper, anyway) stripped down. She sees the skull beneath the skin now; she sees life for what it is: a farce.', 'And like any farce, deceptively minor incidents balloon into larger significance. Take for example, a seemingly innocuous encounter between Vee and terminal cancer patient Miss Rosa (Barbara Rosenblat). Rosa says that Vee is a \xe2\x80\x9cvery rude woman\xe2\x80\x9d after Vee forces her to move tables in the cafeteria, and that rudeness is the thing that comes back to bite Vee in the end. After managing to escape Litchfield following her attack on Red, Vee tries to flag down a passing van \xe2\x80\x94 unaware that it\xe2\x80\x99s driven by Rosa, who has also escaped prison, aided by Morello. Rosa, recognizing Vee (\xe2\x80\x9calways so rude, that one\xe2\x80\x9d), instead runs her over. There\xe2\x80\x99s a fitting irony here: Rudeness, like karma, is a shadow that you cannot outrun. A chance encounter becomes one\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate end; as Vee\xe2\x80\x99s body hits the ground, her eyes, tellingly, are open. After an entire season of intense and almost Shakespearean plotting and scheming over control of the tunnel and black market operations, that this is Vee\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate fate \xe2\x80\x94 run down by a woman whom she slighted and who had nothing to do with the contraband plot \xe2\x80\x94 is incredibly significant.', 'Netflix', 'Prison is some metaphorical fire, burning away one\xe2\x80\x99s civilized fa\xc3\xa7ade to reveal some essential truth beneath the surface, and Season 2 of', 'demonstrates this even further. With little control over their freedom of movement, the smallest act takes on larger meaning within Litchfield, such as the selection of a hairstyle. One of Vee\xe2\x80\x99s first Svengali-like manipulations of Suzanne is to remove the tightly coiled Bantu hair knots so closely associated with her, requiring her to change a facet of herself. (In doing so, Suzanne becomes far more violent under Vee\xe2\x80\x99s care than before.) Likewise, Taystee exchanges her curls for tight cornrows; it\xe2\x80\x99s a signifier that she\xe2\x80\x99s not the same Taystee as before. As Vee extends her control over Black Cindy (Adrienne C. Moore) and Watson (Vicky Jeudy), her own hair changes, moving from the matted and tamped-down style she has upon her arrival at Litchfield to a lush mane once she secures a hold over Taystee and her friends. Offering more than just cake, she promises protection and a lioness\xe2\x80\x99 hold.', 'But the hair metamorphoses extend beyond Vee\xe2\x80\x99s crew. Pennsatucky, in looking for a new identity, opts to have her hair chopped off after falling in with Big Boo (Lea DeLaria) during the storm. Piper emerges from prison for her 48 hours of furlough with her hair blonder and shinier, thanks to Sophia (Laverne Cox). And Red, faded and gray after falling out of power in Season 1, opts for a visit to Sophia in order to restore her fiery mane. When she steps out of the chair, she has not only reclaimed her thirst for power, but also the redness of her roots.', 'Yet, it\xe2\x80\x99s Red who realizes that the war between her and Vee does not define her, nor does her slip into vicious reprisal. Still, their battle \xe2\x80\x94 over who controls the flow of contraband into Litchfield \xe2\x80\x94 turns deadly. After Taslitz (Judith Roberts) mistakenly shanks an unnamed black prisoner (thinking she\xe2\x80\x99s Vee), the tension between the two groups moves from a simmer to a full-on boil. Red attempts to strangle Vee with some plastic wrap on a deserted loading dock, picking her moment well, but she can\xe2\x80\x99t bring herself to finish the job. (\xe2\x80\x9cThis place is getting to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, ruefully.) Vee, however, has no such compunctions, slocking Red repeatedly in the greenhouse. Red retains her humanity but nearly loses an eye; Vee, however, knows that you can\xe2\x80\x99t play at war \xe2\x80\x94 you have to go all in or not at all.', 'Netflix', 'Season 2 can be seen as being structured around the war between Red and Vee, the two women acting as poles between which much of the action occurs. Characters fade in and out of focus in the second season, allowing for Miss Rosa, Sister Ingalls, Morello, Poussey, and others to get their own flashback episodes; likewise, the season begins with Schilling\xe2\x80\x99s Piper transported to another prison altogether, forcing her to contend with new characters and situations. Inasmuch as Piper acts as the audience\xe2\x80\x99s entry to the narrative \xe2\x80\x94 her na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 is contrasted here with that of new inmate Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn), a self-absorbed political activist \xe2\x80\x94 the second season of', 'reminds us that this is a true ensemble; Episode 2, \xe2\x80\x9cLooks Blue, Tastes Red,\xe2\x80\x9d is entirely Piper-free, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel lacking as a result.', 'For all of the audience apathy that Piper (sometimes fairly) receives, Schilling delivers a tremendous performance this season. While glimpses of the old Piper emerge from time to time, Season 2 finds a stronger, deeper Piper who has been tempered by her experiences at Litchfield and elsewhere. The scene of Piper drinking a 40 and eating fast food on the bridge, alone, would indicate just how far this character has come. She has accepted her criminality and sees herself through a different lens. Her prison sentence isn\xe2\x80\x99t a detour from her life; this', 'her life.

One problem: The Kitty Pryde of the movies wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even born in 1973. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce we made the decision that we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna send someone\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness back in time, given that we cast Ellen Page \xe2\x80\x94 and we loved Ellen Page as Kitty \xe2\x80\x94 we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t send her back to the days of Michael Fassbender and McAvoy and Jen Lawrence; she\xe2\x80\x99d be, like, negative 20 years old,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t actually have her consciousness wake up in her body, because it would be a sperm cell.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'And that\xe2\x80\x99s where the plot of', 'had to immediately diverge from the comic.

The irony of that felt really rich to me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen that dynamic in a time travel movie before.\xe2\x80\x9d', '3.

So the truth is, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have that many scenes that take place in the future. We have the opening scene that sets it up, and then very quickly they\xe2\x80\x99re in the monastery and Logan\xe2\x80\x99s being sent back in time, and we\xe2\x80\x99re really just cutting to them in the monastery.

And there are some shocking deaths in the first reel \xe2\x80\x94 which are, no real spoiler here, quickly done away with thanks to some of Kitty Pryde\xe2\x80\x99s time-travel mojo. But the film quickly becomes something of a zippy and rousing time-travel adventure, with James McAvoy\xe2\x80\x99s Charles Xavier doing all of the angsty heavy lifting with a rather on-the-nose heroin addiction metaphor.', 'Yes, Xavier\xe2\x80\x99s addiction metaphor was way too obviously structured, and provided a way too overt crucible for the man who is meant to be the moral compass of the franchise. I want to address the strangeness of Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s new power set in a bit. But what the film accomplishes is diminishing the raw power of the original plot, which is rooted in a Holocaust analogy. The stakes are high in both the comic and the film, and we see that single shot of a concentration camp in the opening sequence, but the metaphor is quickly dissipated. In the comic, we\xe2\x80\x99re forced to experience the reality of the survivors in the concentration camp in the future, survivors who are branded with clothes that immediately identify them as mutants, much like the yellow star in Nazi Germany.

(We see how those horrors play out within the future versions of Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Magneto, and others.) The fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting against the Mutant Registration Act is also important; their struggles are that of civil rights in a world that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them or their self-identification.

To me, the fact that it happened under such unexpected and illogical circumstances compounded the tragedy. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a protracted cancer storyline where Will learns he\xe2\x80\x99s dying and has to say good-bye to Alicia. There is no good-bye, no closure, no catharsis about the time they lost fighting. His life ended, sadly and without reason.', 'Oh god, a drawn-out death storyline would have been the worst.

I have a lot of faith in the writers of', ', and I think there were other directions they could have taken the story that would have felt more organic and true to the tone of the show. I do, however, like the lack of closure, and I think it was important for Will and Alicia to end their relationship on such tenuous footing. But while on one level I appreciate the meaninglessness of his death \xe2\x80\x94 insofar as that feels true to life \xe2\x80\x94 I have trouble getting behind the randomness when it could have carried more thematic weight.', 'That\xe2\x80\x99s just it \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s senseless and brutal and truly shocking in that respect. There is an element of randomness to it: What if that cop had had the clasp on his holster secured? What if Jeffrey hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been accused of a crime that he seemingly didn\xe2\x80\x99t commit? What if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t terrified for his life within Cook County holding? Will\xe2\x80\x99s death is inorganic to the show and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it matters, really. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the climax to a season-long arc; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about the rivalry between the two firms, or even about his doomed romance with Alicia. It came out of nowhere. He was shot to death by his client. In a courtroom. With Diane a room away. And he died somewhere between that room and the hospital. The reveal isn\xe2\x80\x99t operatic, but gut-wretching as Kalinda and Diane peel back that sheet. It\xe2\x80\x99s horrifying in its very simplicity.', 'Absolutely agree with you there. What I loved about that moment is that they teased the dramatic scene of doctors struggling to save Will\xe2\x80\x99s life on the table, when in fact he was DOA.

But that\xe2\x80\x99s where the show thrives where others would have failed. Killing off a character could be inherently thought of, on any show, as potentially cheap. But I refuse to agree that this is a cheap twist. To me, in an era where character deaths are essentially played out, this one had meaning and consequences for the characters in a palpable, major way. There is no escaping the fact that Alicia and Diane and everyone will have to confront Will\xe2\x80\x99s death head-on. But his death also means ending the love triangle that Alicia was trapped within.', 'And how happy are we that the love triangle is over? Always one of the least interesting aspects of the show. I am more interested in Kalinda and Cary than I was in Alicia and Will, and I am not interested in Kalinda and Cary. And I\xe2\x80\x99m excited to see where the show goes from here, in terms of Alicia and Diane\xe2\x80\x99s relationship. Obviously they now share this common loss, but can that erase everything else that happened between them? Honestly, though, I still think there were more stories to be told with Alicia and Will \xe2\x80\x94 and I get that the writers\xe2\x80\x99 hands were tied because of Charles\xe2\x80\x99 decision to leave \xe2\x80\x94 but I want more there. That was a major part of what made this season so exciting.', '', 'Ultimately, it comes down to the writers turning what they had at their disposal into something workable and meaningful. Josh Charles leaving', 'ensured that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any more Will-Alicia storylines, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine because at least we\xe2\x80\x99re not forced to suffer awkward plots that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see: like, \xe2\x80\x9cJosh Charles guest stars on a new episode of', ', when Will visits Chicago after living as a monk in Nepal for two years!\xe2\x80\x9d I think he had to die in order to make this departure stick, as it were. As for moving forward, it seems clear to me that a merger could be in the cards (a re-merger?) and that Alicia and Diane will perhaps make peace. However, I disagree that Kalinda and Cary aren\xe2\x80\x99t interesting, though I am far more invested in the Alicia-Kalinda dynamic, even though we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a hint of their friendship in several years now. Maybe Will dying will mean that the two will actually appear in a scene together.', 'Please! There is so much more to be done with the relationship between Alicia and Kalinda, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been deprived for far too long.

Bringing back Louis Canning (Michael J. Fox) in any capacity is a good thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m also curious to see how Jeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s storyline will play out, if at all, because I\xe2\x80\x99m still convinced he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it! And I want Will\xe2\x80\x99s death to have some tangible effect besides what it means for the characters \xe2\x80\x94 prison reform, perhaps?', 'Michael J. Fox returning as Louis is really a good thing! And I agree: Jeffrey didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill Dani, which we\xe2\x80\x99ll likely learn next week when Hunter Parrish returns. I think that Finn (the new Matthew Goode character) will likely have to bear that cross when that fact comes out, as his prosecution led an innocent man to open fire on a courtroom. You don\xe2\x80\x99t come back from that without scars, both physical and psychological ones. On the other front, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a need for course-correcting here, however. This was a meaningful way to add a patina of loss and tragedy onto the Will-Alicia dynamic and Will\xe2\x80\x99s death will have lasting consequences for everyone, at both firms. If the show is, as the Kings have long held, about the education of Alicia Florrick, there are tough lessons to be had here. The March 16 episode (\xe2\x80\x9cA Few Words\xe2\x80\x9d) showed us an Alicia who was getting back into the law and facing numerous obstacles; Will offered her a lifeline and transformed her life when no one else would. With Will gone, those elevator doors have closed for the last time. And Alicia may have to force them open herself. That\xe2\x80\x99s progress for the character and for the show. And I defy anyone who sees his death as manipulative or cheap. It mattered to the audience and to the characters. Will won\xe2\x80\x99t be soon forgotten, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the best that any of us \xe2\x80\x94 fictional or real \xe2\x80\x94 can hope for.', 'airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on CBS.', 'You are signed in as', '.', 'Was That ""Good Wife"" Twist Cheap Or Profound?', 'Your link was successfully shared!', 'More Buzz', 'Note: once you save these links, they will no longer update automatically.', 'More Buzz', 'Note: once you save these links, they will no longer update automatically.', '', '', 'This video may have privacy restrictions.

Yes, the movie is a bit of fan service (given that it was, well, entirely funded by the fans) and it certainly plays that way, even with the recap at the beginning designed to catch non-viewers up. (Are non-viewers going to see this movie? I doubt it.)

Have I mentioned Bell? Bell. Bell\xe2\x80\x99s a ringing, Bell on wheels, Bell and whistles, etc. Her delivery is sharp, and she punctuates everything she says with wit (but not wink), intelligence, and when the scene calls for it, a deep sadness.

But back to the praise! Bell and her co-star Jason Dohring, as Logan, still have chemistry, both romantically and by being able to throw ping-pong-fast dialogue at each other. Gaby Hoffmann and James Franco (playing himself) both have inventive little arcs. I also liked the continued menace in Neptune; and I liked the sense that the characters, whom we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen for years, really have progressed in their lives \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re all kind of different now, imperceptibly but actually.

I have nothing personally against Chris Lowell or Percy Daggs III, but if you compare their on-screen presence to that of Bell or Dohring, you can see the inequalities at play in a way. Just look at the dynamic between between Bell and Lowell and then compare it to the sizzle that happens every time Veronica and Logan are in a room together. But that\xe2\x80\x99s also an issue with how Piz as a character has been constructed and presented. He\xe2\x80\x99s not the most exciting choice \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s the safest choice. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll agree that there\xe2\x80\x99s an almost haphazard quality to the direction; at times the film seems to lag a little, but then individual scenes are themselves devoid of air. There\xe2\x80\x99s a deft sharpness to the dialogue and delivery (again, especially Bell\xe2\x80\x99s) that, yes, does get lost at times.', 'I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be able to convince you that this movie isn\xe2\x80\x99t very good.

While that whodunit is rather shortform compared to, say, those within Season 1 and 2 of', ', it\xe2\x80\x99s a whodunit nonetheless, with the discovery of a crime (one with a connection to Veronica), multiple suspects, an investigation, and a resolution.

And, while imperfect, I quite liked the film!', 'The mystery is fine. Like, it\xe2\x80\x99s OK.

It\xe2\x80\x99s student film-y, and a JV effort at that. It exists more for in-jokes and callbacks than for any other reason.

Yes, there are a lot of callbacks and in-jokes layered throughout the film and the notion of returning to one\xe2\x80\x99s past is clearly an intended theme, but I did feel as though the characters develop \xe2\x80\x94 or at least Veronica and Logan do, which is ultimately the central conceit here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll grant you this: The other characters are basically window dressing for the romantic arc. They\xe2\x80\x99re victims or villains, or collateral damage.

The silence went on for so long and got so awkward that eventually the boy spoke up.', '\xe2\x80\x9cI told the teacher that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sit next to him because he was too quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert Dohman. \xe2\x80\x9cHe turns around and goes, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, blondie boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m not quiet!\xe2\x80\x99 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the way me and Michael get along now.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Michael Jr. was voted \xe2\x80\x9cfriendliest\xe2\x80\x9d by his sixth-grade classmates and elected homecoming king in eighth grade. His popularity was a testament to his ability to navigate the unspoken color line of a small Southern town; most of his close friends were white.', '\xe2\x80\x9cMy grandma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dohman, \xe2\x80\x9cwas very old-school and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into all that racial mixing. But when I had Michael over, he\xe2\x80\x99d always be the first one to come over and give everybody a hug. Even her. He really changed the way my grandmother looked at black people. She would even smile when he came around.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Michael Sr. said he saw little of the outgoing side of his son, saying he was quiet at home. But coaches and teachers remember him as a precociously self-assured teenager who could start a conversation with anyone. After football games, Michael Jr. was known for going into the bleachers \xe2\x80\x94 uniform and pads still on \xe2\x80\x94 to introduce himself to parents.', 'Michael could \xe2\x80\x9ctalk to a group of 15-year-olds and then set there and talk to a group of 55-year-olds and not feel out of place either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smith, now head football coach at Hitchcock. \xe2\x80\x9cI just never had a student that could just go and talk to a group of people. He would make friends all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Even in what was ostensibly enemy territory. Smith recalled a track meet at Danbury, a nearby town that is 90% white, less than 1% black, and had developed a reputation for being unfriendly to minorities. Except, apparently, Michael Jr.', '\xe2\x80\x9cI can remember some Danbury parents cheering and rooting for Michael running the 100-meter\xe2\x80\x9d dash, Coach Smith said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that, if you know anything about Danbury.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Maybe the biggest benefit of playing sports is that it kept Michael Jr. away from his brothers. The coaches, who also worked as teachers in the district, knew all about Josh and Chris: Their obvious athleticism had never proven to be worth the trouble. But Michael Jr. was charting a path different from the men in his family. Michael Jr. greeted people with hugs, not fists. He was going to be the first to graduate.', '\xe2\x80\x9cMichael was a good kid,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael Sr. said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be like his brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d Left unsaid was that Michael Jr. clearly felt the same about his father.', '', 'On fall Friday nights, Michael Sr. said he would find a seat somewhere in Hitchcock\xe2\x80\x99s football stadium, away from the crowd and sometimes with his father, Wesley. After nearly 30 years as a father, he said, he could finally engage in the autumn ritual familiar across Texas.', '\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss [any] home game his senior year,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael Sr. insisted.', 'There isn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone who can corroborate his perfect attendance. Family and friends say they\xe2\x80\x99re sure he went to some games but don\xe2\x80\x99t know about all of them. The coaches at Hitchcock High can remember seeing or, rather, hearing, Michael Sr. only once in four years: a game in Michael Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s sophomore year.', '\xe2\x80\x9cI heard this guy yelling at Michael and I turned to Michael and asked him, \xe2\x80\x98Who the hell is that guy?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Smith recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cMichael said it was his father.

I can look up in those stands and know who\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Michael Sr. said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it a priority to spend any time with the parents of Michael Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s friends or the alums and other regulars who would show up at school events \xe2\x80\x94 most of them white. \xe2\x80\x9cI never did know them,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael Sr. said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I never tried to go out of my way.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Michael Sr. said he took a job with a trucking company based out of Ada, Oklahoma, so that he could arrive in Hitchcock by the start of kickoff Friday night. He assumed his son appreciated what he considered a significant sacrifice of time and money; coming back to Texas without a load meant he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid for the drive home.', 'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until earlier this year, when media outlets began saying that he had abandoned his son, that Michael Sr. learned he was being phased out of the story of his son\xe2\x80\x99s childhood. He never thought all those years on the road would mean that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.', '\xe2\x80\x9cMichael\xe2\x80\x99s family was the city of Hitchcock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dohman, Michael Jr.\xe2\x80\x99s childhood friend.', 'Told what Dohman said, Michael Sr. looked straight ahead, the anger washing over him. Sitting on that patio at the nursing home, he was, for a few moments, that angry Sam boy ready to fight.', '\xe2\x80\x9cThe city of Hitchcock didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy his goddamn clothes, a roof over his head, or the bed that he slept in,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael Sr. said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe city of Hitchcock can kiss my ass.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have kept those gas receipts.\xe2\x80\x9d', 'Of course, Michael Sr. never thought he would need them. He also never thought the family of a high school teammate \xe2\x80\x94 a white one \xe2\x80\x94 would get so much credit.', 'Once Michael Jr. revealed in February his plans to become the NFL\xe2\x80\x99s first out gay player, the two media outlets with which his publicists coordinated the announcement wrote this:', ': Sam found a comfortable place off the field as well, in large part because of Ethan Purl, a classmate and the son of Ron Purl, the president of the local branch of Prosperity Bank. Ron\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Candy, made sure their house was part recreation center and part counseling hub for their children and their friends. By Sam\xe2\x80\x99s senior year, he had his own bedroom in the Purls\xe2\x80\x99 house, along with chores like cleaning the pool and carrying the grocery bags. \xe2\x80\x9cI look at our house as a kind of safe haven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ron Purl, who keeps a photograph of Sam in his Missouri football uniform in his office. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is just another son.
