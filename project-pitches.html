<h3><font color="navy">1. Is Twitter contributing to writer's block?</font></h3>
<img src="tejucole.png" align="middle">
<br>
<br>
<p><i>Writers often lament that social media takes eyes away from their product. But is it also preventing them from putting out that product in the first place? I follow several magazine and news writers on Twitter, and some of them come up with pithy, 140-character sentences that could either distract them from writing, or blossom into an article. To find out whether Twitter is a roadblock or a beacon, I want to compare the frequency of an author's tweets and published articles, limiting it to web writers since they're always within reach of their social media accounts.</i></p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Form:</strong></font> A graph, accompanied by three short profiles of web writers who I've found to be most active on Twitter. How and why do they use the medium?</p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Potential data sources:</strong></font> <a href="http://topsy.com">Topsy</a> (contains Twitter stats in graph form, which I could mine to make my own data set)</p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Potential human sources:</strong></font> Web writers from <a href="http://www.vulture.com">Vulture</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com">Slate</a> or <a href="http://www.salon.com">Salon</a></p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>What I need to learn:</strong></font> How to count all online articles published under an individual writer's name, for a specific time period. (Do I have to search each site, or all of Google?)</p>

<h3><font color="navy">2. Are these twin sisters in a popularity contest on Instagram?</font></h3>

<p><i>As bloggers race to increase their number of followers, the most obsessed have turned to buying follower-bots, according to <a href="http://racked.com/archives/2014/09/11/buy-instagram-followers-bloggers.php">Racked</a>. In the Philippines, the <a href="http://vulcanpost.com/12971/research-philippines-social-media/">"social networking capital of the world,"</a> the practice has found an interesting case study in twins An and En Estrada. The two became popular for their blog <a href="http://youreviltwindiary.tumblr.com">youreviltwindiary.tumblr.com</a> but have since shifted to maintaining separate accounts on IG. But while both have thousands of followers, <a href="http://instagram.com/trasienne">En</a> has 5,000 more than <a href="http://instagram.com/tracianne">An</a>. A shocker, since An is the more personable twin in real life. Having observed sudden spikes in En's numbers, I am inclined to think that she's buying followers. Is there truth to this hypothesis?</i></p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Form:</strong></font> An investigative article that compares the proportion of bots to real followers for each account, and a timeline that charts sudden spikes in either of their followers</p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Potential data sources:</strong></font> <a href="http://topsy.com">Topsy</a> (contains IG stats) and this Bot Or Not (http://truthy.indiana.edu/botornot/) test by Indiana University</p>

<p><font color="navy"><strong>What I need to learn:</strong></font> How to crunch the IG handles of 72,000 combined followers into the Bot Or Not test, and scrape data about the number of followers by time period off Topsy</p>

<h3><font color="navy">3. How slow are The Times?</font></h3>
<img src="NYTOnIt.png" align="middle">
<br>
<br>
<p><i><a href="https://twitter.com/NYTOnIt">The Times Is On It</a> is a parody Twitter account that pokes fun at how The New York Times writes trend pieces about things that are obvious. It got me to think about their style section, and how long it takes for a trend to appear in their pages, versus on so-called "coolhunting" blogs.</i></p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Form:</strong></font> A timeline that compares when the Times reported on a design trend, versus when it came out on <a href="http://trendland.com">Trendland</a>, <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com">Cool Hunting</a>, <a href="https://www.nowness.com">Nowness</a>, <a href="http://www.highsnobiety.com">High Snobiety</a> and <a href="http://honestlywtf.com">Honestly WTF</a></p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Potential data sources:</strong></font> NYT.com and the blogs mentioned above</p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Potential human sources:</strong></font> Editors from NYT's Style Section, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ani-tzenkova/33/53b/6a8">Ani Tzenkova</a> of Trendland</p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>What I need to learn:</strong></font> How to make my own methodology. I am thinking of picking up four individual NYT Style sections, chosen randomly from each quarter of the past year. I would identify all the trends mentioned by the Times and then search for their first mention in the blogs. Then come up with a formula or a numerical coefficient that predicts how long after a trend runs on a blog, will it likely come out in the Times. The purpose of this is to build a widget, by which a reader could plug in a link to an actual blog article, and it would spit out a fake screenshot of the Times with the same headline - but a much later date.</p>
