<h3><font color="navy">1. If writers wrote as much as they tweeted, would they have written a full book by now?</font></h3>

<p><i>Writers lament that social media takes eyes away from their product. But is it also preventing them from putting out that product in the first place? Some book authors are always on Twitter, that I want to do a word count of all their tweets, compare it to the word count of their bestselling titles and see if in the time they spent tweeting, they could have already finished the equivalent of one or several books.</i></p>

<h3><font color="navy">2. Are these twin sisters in a popularity contest on Instagram?</font></h3>

<p><i>As bloggers race to increase their number of followers, the most obsessed have turned to buying follower-bots, according to <a href="http://racked.com/archives/2014/09/11/buy-instagram-followers-bloggers.php">Racked</a>. In the Philippines, the <a href="http://vulcanpost.com/12971/research-philippines-social-media/">"social networking capital of the world,"</a> the practice has found an interesting case study in twins An and En Estrada. The two became popular for their blog youreviltwindiary.tumblr.com but have since shifted to maintaining separate accounts on IG. But while both have thousands of followers, En has 5,000 more than An. A shocker, since An is the more personable twin in real life. Having observed sudden spikes in En's numbers, I am inclined to think that she's buying followers. Is there truth to this hypothesis?</i></p>

<h3><font color="navy">3. How slow are The Times?</font></h3>
<img src="NYTOnIt.png" align="middle">
<br>
<br>
<p><i><a href="https://twitter.com/NYTOnIt">The Times Is On It</a> is a parody Twitter account that pokes fun at how The New York Times writes trend pieces about things that are obvious. It got me to think about their style section, and how long it takes for a trend to appear in their pages, versus on so-called "coolhunting" blogs.</i></p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Form:</strong></font> A timeline that compares when the Times reported on a design trend, versus when it came out on <a href="http://trendland.com">Trendland</a>, <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com">Cool Hunting</a>, <a href="https://www.nowness.com">Nowness</a>, <a href="http://www.highsnobiety.com">High Snobiety</a> and <a href="http://honestlywtf.com">Honestly WTF</a></p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Potential data sources:</strong></font> NYT.com and the blogs mentioned above</p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>Potential human sources:</strong></font> Editors from NYT's Style Section, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ani-tzenkova/33/53b/6a8">Ani Tzenkova</a> of Trendland</p>
<p><font color="navy"><strong>What I need to learn:</strong></font> How to make my own methodology. I am thinking of picking up four individual NYT Style sections, chosen randomly from each quarter of the past year. I would identify all the trends mentioned by the Times and then search for their first mention in the blogs. Then come up with a formula or a numerical coefficient that predicts how long after a trend runs on a blog, will it likely come out in the Times. The purpose of this is to build a widget, by which a reader could plug in a link to an actual blog article, and it would spit out a fake screenshot of the Times with the same headline - but a much later date.</p>
